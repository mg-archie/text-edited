# Text Edited

## Description

A text editor structured as a progressive web application meaning it can be downloaded locally and ran while offline.

I was motivated to show the power of service worker in providing a web app the experience that rivals that of types of applications and software.  I built it to display new found skills in webpack development.  I learnt the importance of properly structured dependancies, extensive debuggind and architectural soundness.
